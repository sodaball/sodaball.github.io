I am currently a master's student in Computer Science at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), after completing my undergraduate studies at [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/). My research interests include AI for scientific discovery (AI+Sci), graph representation learning, neural network interpretability, and uncertainty quantification.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yang](http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/sail/user:yueyang) of the [YangLab](http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/sail/research) at Sun Yat-sen University.
